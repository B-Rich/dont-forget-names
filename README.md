These are the formulas [CQuIC](https://cquic.unm.edu) people use daily :)

Thanks to Joshua Combes, Adrian Chapman, Ninnat Dangniam and many former CQuIC students.

To render the TeX file into PDF, you can run `make` from your command line terminal if you have both a `LaTeX` compiler (like [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)) and the [Make tool](https://www.gnu.org/s/make/) installed. 
Otherwise, the normal LaTeX-->PDFLaTeX compiling process will do the trick.
